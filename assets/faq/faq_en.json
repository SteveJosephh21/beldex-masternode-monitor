    "question": "What is a masternode?",
    "answer": "A masternode is a node that helps produce and validate blocks on the Beldex network. Masternode operators essentially hold a stake within the network and are responsible for maintaining its security and normal functioning.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of a masternode in the Beldex network?",
    "answer": "Masternodes produce and validate blocks as well as serve the DApps built on top of the Beldex network. They act as a storage server for encrypting, storing, and relaying messages through BChat. They also serve as an onion router and exit nodes for BelNet.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I set up a Beldex masternode?",
    "answer": "To set up a Beldex masternode, you need to download the Bucephalus v4.0.2 software and must meet the following hardware requirements.\n\nLatest Binary - Bucephalus v4.0.2 \nSoftware        - Ubuntu 18.04 \nStorage          - 30-50 GB \nRAM               - 2-4 GB \nCPU                - 1 Core \n"

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the collateral required to set up as masternode?",
    "answer": "The collateral required to set up a Beldex masternode is 10000 BDX.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are masternode rewards?",
    "answer": "Rewards are incentives given to masternode operators for contributing to the network’s functioning and security.\nRewards help the MN operators pay the server fees and cover other expenses.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "How are masternode rewards calculated?",
    "answer": "Each masternode is rewarded based on a reward queue and the number of masternodes in the network.\nTo calculate your rewards, you can use this formula: (Total blocks produced per day*6.25) / number of nodes in the network.\nYou can also check https://www.beldex.io/masternode for an interactive BDX reward calculator.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I register multiple masternodes on a single wallet?",
    "answer": "Yes. A single wallet can be used to register multiple masternodes. But it must hold the collateral required for all the masternodes that you wish to register.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "I don’t have reliable internet connectivity where I live. How can I run a masternode validator?",
    "answer": "A reliable internet connection and power supply is a necessity to run Beldex masternodes. However, you can take this responsibility off your shoulders by hosting with hosting service providers for a fee.\nBeldex masternodes can be hosted on platforms like AWS, Contabo, Nodehub, Pecunia platform, Perfect Nodes or with masternode shared staking platforms like MyCointainer.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the nominal time taken for a masternode to finish syncing the whole blockchain?",
    "answer": "1-2 days is the nominal time for a full sync of the masternode. Beldex is working to reduce the synchronization time.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I unstake my masternode collateral?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can unstake your collateral by using the CLI wallet.\n"
  },
  {
    "question": "My node was deregistered. For how long will the collateral be locked? Is there a place where I can check the remaining time?",
    "answer": "To check if your node is decommissioned or deregistered, enter its public key on https://explorer.beldex.io/. If your node was deregistered, your collateral will be locked for a period of time equivalent to the time required to produce 86400 blocks.\n"
  },
  {
    "question":"Can I run a Beldex node on IPv6?",
    "answer": "Currently, Beldex nodes can only be run on IPv4.\n"
  },
  {
    "question":"I’m facing an error while setting up the Beldex masternode. What should I do?",
    "answer": "Try troubleshooting by following the steps on https://docs.beldex.io. If that doesn’t help, you can contact support@beldex.io or join our discord server (https://discord.com/invite/Hj4MAmA5gs) where our devs and masternode operators from the community will guide you through the setup process.\n"
  },
  {
    "question":"What is the block credit and how do I earn it?",
    "answer": "Block credits are earned by masternodes from the time they register on the network. The longer a masternode has contributed to the network, the higher is its block credit. Block credits help when a node is decommissioned due to not submitting an uptime proof. You can check your Masternode’s block credit on https://explorer.beldex.io/.\n"
  },
  {
    "question":"What is the IP change penalty?",
    "answer": "Beldex masternodes require a static IP address. When you change the IP of your masternode, then you will incur an IP change penalty, in which case, your node will be sent to the end of the reward queue and you may miss a few rewards temporarily.\n"
